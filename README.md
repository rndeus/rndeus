## 🧠 About Me
I’m an 18-year-old **Full Stack Software Engineer** with a strong preference for **back-end development**.  
I enjoy building systems from the ground up, solving complex problems, and working with architecture, performance, and real-world integrations.  
For me, programming is not just coding — it’s **engineering**.
